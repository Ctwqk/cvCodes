Description:
	Regarding my project, in my original proposal, I intended to include object detection, a snake game utilizing this technology, and a GUI developed with Qt. However, I now realize that completing the Qt-based GUI may not be feasible within the remaining timeframe. Despite this, I am confident in my ability to complete the detecting and snake game part.
	This project aims to merge physical and digital realities, allowing  players to control a 3D snake game through real-world movements captured  via a camera system. This approach not only innovates upon traditional  gaming mechanics but also explores practical applications of augmented  reality in entertainment technologies.
